Influential Organizations

Top organizations by number of AI systems created (Task 5 - needs actual query results):

Run this query and add results here:
SELECT 
    o.org_name AS organization_name, 
    COUNT(s.system) AS system_count
FROM 
    orgs o
JOIN 
    systems s ON o.org_id = s.org_id
GROUP BY 
    o.org_name
ORDER BY 
    system_count DESC
LIMIT 10;


Image Generation Leaders

## AI Development Over Time

Growth of AI systems by year with largest model parameters:

| Year | System Count | Max Parameters |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 2023 | 341 | 1.6 trillion |
| 2022 | 171 | 540 billion |
| 2021 | 136 | 1.6 trillion |
| 2020 | 125 | 600 billion |
| 2019 | 126 | 100 billion |
| 2018 | 91 | 8 billion |
| 2017 | 108 | 8.7 billion |
| 2016 | 78 | 278 million |
| 2015 | 46 | 271 million |
| 2014 | 42 | 62 billion |
| 2013 | 29 | 20 billion |

Key insight: Exponential growth from 2013 onward. 2023 saw 341 systems created, and model sizes increased from millions to trillions of parameters.

Top 5 AI Problems

Most common problems organizations work on:

| AI Problem | Organization Count |
|------------|-------------------|
| Image generation | 154 |
| Image classification | 77 |
| Language modelling | 45 |
| Code generation | 45 |
| Proteins | 40 |

**Key insight:** Image generation is by far the most popular AI problem, with nearly 2x more organizations than image classification.
